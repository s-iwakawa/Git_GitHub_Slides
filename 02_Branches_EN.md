## git branch command
1. First, go back to the `learning_git` repository

    ```sh
    cd Documents/learning_git
    ```

2. Use `git branch` command to see all of the branches in your repo & which branch you are currently on.

    ```sh
    git branch

    * main
    ```

### `git branch`
* [git-branch](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch)
* Command to display branch list
* The branch with an asterisk (*) is the current branch
* If your default branch name is `master`, change it with the following command:
  * `git config --global init.defaultBranch main`

## Create a new branch
First, let's create a branch named `develop` and switch to it.

  ```sh
  git checkout -b develop

  ...

  Switched to a new branch 'develop'
  ```

### `git checkout -b <branch name>`
* This command creates a new branch in the repo & switches to it.
* [git-checkout Doc](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout)

## Add a file to the develop branch

1. Create a file on the `develop` branch

    ```sh
    touch develop_file.md
    ```

1. Use `git add` & `git commit` commands to save it in your local repo

    ```sh
    git add develop_file.md
    git commit -m "develop only"
    ```

    ```sh
    [develop 4f98baf] develop only
    1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
    create mode 100644 develop_file.md
    ```

1. Use `git status` command to verify changes

    ```sh
    git status
    ```

    ```sh
    On branch develop
    nothing to commit, working tree clean
    ```

1. Use `git push` command to upload changes to GitHub

    ```sh
    git push -u origin develop
    ```

    ```sh
    Enumerating objects: 4, done.
    Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
    Delta compression using up to 4 threads
    Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 277 bytes | 277.00 KiB/s, done.

    remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:
    remote:   https://github.com/ahandsel/learning_git_3.git
    remote:
    remote: Create a pull request for 'develop' on GitHub by visiting:
    remote:      https://github.com/ahandsel/learning_git_3/pull/new/develop
    remote:
    To https://github.com/ahandsel/learning_git_3.git
    * [new branch]      develop -> develop
    Branch 'develop' set up to track remote branch 'develop' from 'origin'.
    ```

### Verify on GitHub Desktop App
Let's verify the changes by viewing it on the GitHub Desktop App

1. Open the app with the following command:

    ```shell
    cd learning_git
    github .
    ```

2. App will open to a `Add Local Repository` setting page, click the `Add Repository` button

3. Click `History` Tab to view the changes you have made

## See the changes on GitHub

Go to the `Network graph` setting on your GitHub repo to see the changes you have made
* `https://github.com/USER/REPO/network`
* Example: `https://github.com/ahandsel/Git_GitHub_Slides/network`

|                                                                                          |                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                |

## Create & Merge a Pull Request

`Pull Requests`So, you can check other users' changes etc. before the file is actually changed.

* Used for code reviews, etc.

`develop`Create in `main`GitHub to merge the branch into the branch.`Pull request`

* Review your changes and `Pull Request`merge.

![Gif_GitHub_Dojo_PullRequest](./img/Gif_GitHub_Dojo_PullRequest.gif)

`main`You see two new files in your branch!

![Example_Pull_Request](./img/Example_Pull_Request.png)

## Update local repo from GitHub repo
`main` Let's move to the branch.

```sh
git checkout main
```

Currently, GitHub repositories have more up-to-date files than local repositories.

```sh
  Switched to branch 'main'
  Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 4 commits & can be fast-forwarded
    (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
```

Use the `git pull` command to handle this.

Pull the latest version of the repo from GitHub with `git pull origin main`

```sh
git pull origin main
```

```sh
remote: Enumerating objects: 1, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (1/1), 631 bytes | 210.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/ahandsel/kintone_dojo
* branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
  5f9f89b..1438ca5  main     -> origin/main
Updating d775d42..1438ca5
Fast-forward
2nd_file.md     | 0
develop_file.md | 0
2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
create mode 100644 2nd_file.md
create mode 100644 develop_file.md
```

Now the `main`branch and `develop`the branch are in the same state,\
so `develop`let's delete the branch.

```sh
git branch -d develop
```

```sh
  Deleted branch develop (was c6e6c83).
```

`git branch`Let's check with the command

```sh
git branch
```

```sh
  * main
```

## What is Git Branch?

### What is a branch?
* A moving pointer to the commit.
* It can be managed in multiple timelines and changed without affecting the mainline.
* `git checkout`
  * Command to switch branches.
* `git branch -d <branch-name>`
  * Command to delete a branch.

### Why use a branch?
* To separate stable version, development version, experimental version, etc.
* Example: This GitHub slide
  * Each hands-on and concept section can be a branch.
  * You can develop each at the same time.

Ref: [Git - Branches in a Nutshell](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)

## Branch and website
`main`In the branch, there is code that runs the website.

* If `main`changes are made in the branch, it will affect the user! !!

If two developers want to change their website at the same time, create three branches

* `main`→ Live code
* `feature_A`→ Implemented by developer A
* `feature_B`→ Implemented by developer B

When development is complete, merge the branches!

## Git Push vs Pull --Teamwork

| `git push`                                                                                 | `git pull`                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Upload command                                                                             | Download command                                                                           |
| "Push" forces changes to the target repository.                                            | "Pull" gets changes from the target repository                                             |
| `[あなたのコード] ⟾ プッシュ ⟾ [ターゲット]`                                               | `[あなたのコード] ⏎ プル ⏎ [ターゲット]`                                                   |
| A "push request" is a target repository that requests you to push changes.                 | A "pull request" is to request the target repository to get changes.                       |

| `git checkout -b develop`     | Command to switch branches                                           |
| Reasons to use a branch       | Separate code development, testing, public version, etc.             |
| `Pull Requests`When`git pull` | A "pull request" is to request the target repository to get changes. |

### GitHub Repository

![02_Branches_GitHub_Bar_Code](./img/02_Branches_GitHub_Bar_Code.png)

GitHub Repository --Code

* A container that holds all the files related to your project, such as code and documentation.
* All files stored on GitHub are versioned with git
* Repositories are often abbreviated as "repo"
* It is a file to display the introduction of the project etc. displayed at the bottom of the repository.

### GitHub Issues

![02_Branches_GitHub_Bar_Issues](./img/02_Branches_GitHub_Bar_Issues.png)

* Where users discuss the contents of the repository
* You can assign issues to users and add labels to make them easier to read.

### GitHub Pull Request

![02_Branches_GitHub_Bar_PullRequest](./img/02_Branches_GitHub_Bar_PullRequest.png)

* Used when the user wants to make changes to the repository
* Example: When you want to add a new README.md file

### Overview of GitHub

Project boards: Task boards in KANBAN format

Wiki: Allows you to create and save related project documents

Insight: Repository analysis tool

* `Network Graph`: Visualize commits and branches in the timeline
* `Pulse`: Shows tasks in progress or completed
